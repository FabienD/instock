# A litte side project to learn

 * Rust API with [Actix](https://actix.rs/), [Sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), and more.
 * Rust workers (RabbitMQ consumer & producer, via [Lapin](https://docs.rs/lapin/latest/lapin/)),
 * React + Typescript,

The goal of this side project is :

* to track out-of-stock products on e-commerces platforms. I use web scrapping, method that can not work on every site.
* and be notified when available,
